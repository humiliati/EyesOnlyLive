### 2. Event Sequencer

**Location:** M Console mode, upper section  
**Sophistication Level:** ★★★★★ (Highest)

#### Overview
The Event Sequencer is an automated broadcast scheduling engine that executes complex, multi-step event chains on precise schedules.

#### Key Capabilities:

**Sequence Creation:**
- Name and describe sequences
- Add multiple event steps (broadcasts, dispatches, annotations)
- Configure precise timing (milliseconds)
- Set repeat configurations (loop sequences)
- Schedule for future start times

**Event Step Types:**
- **M-Ping**: Direct messages requiring acknowledgment
- **Ops Update**: Operational feed broadcasts
- **Annotation**: Tactical map markers
- **Dispatch**: Asset movement commands
- **Scenario Deploy**: Full scenario activation
- **Lane Update**: Tactical lane creation/modification
- **Patrol Route**: Automated patrol sequences

**Execution Control:**
- **Start**: Begin sequence execution
- **Pause**: Suspend (preserves progress)
- **Resume**: Continue from pause point
- **Cancel**: Terminate immediately

**Real-Time Monitoring:**
- Current step display
- Progress counter (X/Y steps)
- Next step countdown timer
- Total runtime
- Repeat iteration counter

**Advanced Features:**
- **Repeating Sequences**: Loop with configurable interval
- **Scheduled Start**: Begin at specific timestamp
- **Target Filtering**: Send to specific agents
- **Acknowledgment Requirements**: Track responses
- **Auto-Expire**: Time-limited messages

#### Example Use Cases:

**Mission Briefing Cascade:**
```
Step 1 (0s): Send "Mission briefing in 60 seconds"
Step 2 (60s): Send "OPERATION NIGHTFALL is now ACTIVE"
Step 3 (70s): Create map annotation "Primary Objective"
Step 4 (80s): Dispatch assets to starting positions
```

**Timed Narrative Reveal:**
```
Step 1 (0s): "Encrypted transmission intercepted"
Step 2 (120s): "Decryption progress: 30%"
Step 3 (180s): "Decryption progress: 75%"
Step 4 (60s): "INTEL DECRYPTED: Target location identified"
Step 5 (5s): Create critical map annotation at target
```

**Automated Patrol Reminder (Repeating):**
```
Repeat every 1 hour for 8 hours:
  Step 1 (0s): Dispatch asset to checkpoint
  Step 2 (300s): Request status report (requires ACK)
```

### 3. Visual Timeline Editor

**Location:** M Console mode, activated via "Timeline Editor" card  
**Sophistication Level:** ★★★★★ (Highest)

#### Overview
Advanced drag-and-drop interface for creating event sequences with **conditional branching** based on player responses and game state.

#### Revolutionary Feature: Conditional Branching

Unlike linear sequences, the Timeline Editor creates **dynamic narrative flows** that respond to player actions.

#### Branch Condition Types:

1. **Acknowledgment Received**
   - Trigger: Player acknowledges broadcast
   - Options: Require all agents OR any agent
   - Example: "If agents confirm readiness → proceed to phase 2"

2. **Acknowledgment Not Received (Timeout)**
   - Trigger: No response within timeout period
   - Configurable timeout
   - Example: "If no response after 30s → send reminder"

3. **Game is Frozen**
   - Trigger: Game state changes to frozen
   - Example: "If game paused → broadcast 'standby' message"

4. **Game is Unfrozen**
   - Trigger: Game state changes to active
   - Example: "When resumed → trigger next objective"

5. **Time Elapsed**
   - Trigger: Specific duration passes
   - Example: "After 5 minutes → escalate threat level"

6. **Always Execute**
   - Trigger: Unconditional (always runs)
   - Example: "Log event regardless of player response"

#### Interface Features:

- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Intuitive step arrangement
- **Branch Visualization**: Expandable tree structure
- **Nested Execution**: Branches can contain multiple steps
- **Duplicate Steps**: Clone with all branches intact
- **Real-Time Preview**: See execution flow before deployment

#### Example Timeline with Branching:

│                                                     │
│ 🌿 BRANCH 2: On Timeout (No ACK)                   │
│    ├─ Send "URGENT: Acknowledge briefing"          │
│    ├─ Wait 15s                                     │
│    └─ Escalate to M Console operator alert         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 2: Monitor game state                         │
│                                                     │
│ 🌿 BRANCH 1: If Game Frozen                        │
│    └─ Send "Operations suspended - standby"        │
│                                                     │
│ 🌿 BRANCH 2: If Game Active                        │
│    └─ Dispatch assets to positions                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

#### 1. M Console Sync (`src/lib/mConsoleSync.ts`)

**Polling Interval:** 3 seconds

**Broadcasts:**
- `scenario-deploy`: Full scenario activation
- `lane-update`: Tactical lane changes
- `dispatch-command`: Asset movement orders
- `m-ping`: Direct messages
- `ops-update`: Operations feed entries
- `patrol-route-deploy`: Patrol route assignments
- `annotation-update`: Map annotation changes

**Methods:**
- `deployScenario(scenario, by)`
- `dispatchAsset(command, by)`
- `broadcastMPing(message, priority, targets, by)`
- `broadcastAnnotation(action, annotation, annotationId, by)`
- `recordAcknowledgment(ack)`
- `recordAnnotationAcknowledgment(ack)`

#### 2. Game State Sync (`src/lib/gameStateSync.ts`)

**Polling Interval:** 1 second

**State Management:**
- Game freeze/unfreeze
- Emergency panic state
- Player telemetry
- Ping timeout tracking
- Flaps & Seals integration penalties

**Methods:**
- `freezeGame(reason, initiatedBy)`
- `unfreezeGame()`
- `triggerEmergencyPanic(initiatedBy)`
- `publishTelemetry(telemetry)`
- `recordPing(ping)`
- `acknowledgePing(pingId)`
- `getGameStateForFlapsAndSeals()`

#### 3. Event Sequencer (`src/lib/eventSequencer.ts`)

**Check Interval:** 1 second

**Execution Logic:**
- Monitors active sequences
- Checks if steps are ready (nextStepAt <= now)
- Executes ready steps
- Updates sequence progress
- Schedules next steps
- Handles repeating sequences

**Methods:**
- `startSequence(sequenceId)`
- `pauseSequence(sequenceId)`
- `resumeSequence(sequenceId)`
- `cancelSequence(sequenceId)`
- `getSequences()`
- `saveSequence(sequence)`
- `duplicateSequence(sequenceId, newName)`

#### 4. Live ARG Sync (`src/lib/liveArgSync.ts`)

**Real-time Operations:**
- ARG event creation
- Dead drop management
- Agent inventory updates
- Item lifecycle tracking

**Methods:**
- `createArgEvent(event)`
- `activateArgEvent(eventId)`
- `deactivateArgEvent(eventId)`
- `createDeadDrop(drop)`
- `discoverDeadDrop(dropId, discoveredBy)`
- `retrieveDeadDrop(dropId, retrievedBy)`
- `addItemToInventory(agentId, itemId)`
- `removeItemFromInventory(agentId, itemId)`
- `transferItem(fromAgent, toAgent, itemId)`

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Broadcasts Not Received
- **Check:** M Console sync is running (auto-starts)
- **Check:** Watch is polling (should be every 3s)
- **Check:** Target agent IDs match
- **Fix:** Refresh browser on watch
- **Fix:** Toggle M Console mode off/on

#### Sequences Not Executing
- **Check:** Sequence status is "active" (not paused)
- **Check:** Browser tab is active (not throttled)
- **Check:** Step delays are correct (milliseconds internally)
- **Fix:** Check browser console for errors
- **Fix:** Pause and resume sequence

#### Telemetry Not Updating
- **Check:** Game is not frozen
- **Check:** GPS transmission enabled (Red Team)
- **Check:** Watch is transmitting (biometric updates)
- **Fix:** Check last update timestamp
- **Fix:** Restart telemetry sync

#### Items Not Appearing in Inventory
- **Check:** ARG event is activated
- **Check:** Dead drop was retrieved (not just discovered)
- **Check:** Agent ID matches
- **Fix:** Check liveArgSync operations
- **Fix:** Verify item IDs match

### Performance Optimization

**Recommendations:**
- Maximum 5 active sequences simultaneously
- Keep sequences under 20 steps
- Use repeating sequences instead of very long linear ones
- Clean up completed sequences regularly
- Limit GPS breadcrumb trail to 100 points (automatic)
- Archive old mission logs
- Prune old broadcasts (automatic 24h retention)

### Browser Requirements

- **Modern Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **JavaScript:** Must be enabled
- **Cookies:** Required for Spark KV persistence
- **Local Storage:** Required for some caching
- **Screen Resolution:** 768px minimum width for optimal M Console experience
