# ey TODO

## Current priorities
- [ ] Make ops dashboard default **map-first** everywhere and ensure it stays persona-gated.
- [ ] Replace remaining Spark KV scaffolding paths with EyesOnly endpoints (keep fallback only where explicitly desired).
- [ ] Add small UX: show connected callsign/role, scenario name, WS status.

## Follow-ons
- [ ] Add a lightweight ops role management helper view for directors (optional; primary control remains in /m).
